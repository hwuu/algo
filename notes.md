# Part I. Foundations

## Chapter 02. Getting Started

* Insertion sort: P18, as an example of loop invariant.
* Merge sort: P30~34, as an example of divide-and-conquer.
* Bubble sort: P40.
* Number of inversions: P41~42. Modification of merge sort.

## Chapter 03. Growth of Functions

* Theta-notation: P44.

## Chapter 04. Divide-and-Conquer

* Maximum-subarray problem: P68~74. And an O(n) solution: P75.
* Solving computational complexity of recurrences: (I think they are not very important for me currently)
  - Substitution method: P83~87.
  - Recursion-tree: P88~92.
  - The master method: P93~97.

# Part II. Sorting and Order Statistics

* Running time comparison of sort algorithms: P150.

## Chapter 06. Heapsort

* Heap property: P152.
* m x n Young tableus: P167~168.
